:NURSE Agnes: Doctor, we have a man (51 years old) who entered the emergency department reporting chest pain. His vital signs are ABP: 144x92mmHG; HR: 78bpm; RR: 21rpm; Temp: 37oC; O2Sat: 98%.

++ Let us go! (talk-action) -> Level 1 step 2

== Level 1 step 2 (dialog_right) ==

:PATIENT Jakob: Doctor, I am feeling chest pain since yesterday. The pain is continuous and is located just in the middle of my chest, worsening when I breathe and when I lay down on my bed. I suffer from arterial hypertension and smoke 20 cigarettes every day. My father had a “heart attack” at my age and I am very worried about it.

:SUPERVISOR Harry:.
Hi! I am glad that you called me. Chest pain is an important complaint at the emergency department and we have to exclude the fatal causes: myocardial infarction (MI), acute aortic dissection (AAD), pulmonary embolism PE), hypertensive pneumothorax (HP), and Boerhaave Syndrome (BS).

The best way to find out what is happening with your patient, my young padawan, is to gather as much information as possible through history taking and physical examination. We need to search for the signs and symptoms that can guide our clinical reasoning process by changing the pre-test probabilities of each disease.

Do you know the concept of Likelihood ratio (LR)? -> Likelihood Ratio

++ Clinical History Myocardial Infarction
++ Physical Examination Myocardial Infarction
++ Clinical History Aortic Dissection
++ Physical Examination Aortic Dissection
++ Pulmonary Embolism Wells Criteria
++ Back to the Case -> Level 1

Hypertensive pneumothorax is more common in tall and thin young adults (primary pneumothorax) or in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases or chest trauma (secondary pneumothorax). On physical examination, we expect asymmetry in lung auscultation and the trachea may be dislocated to the contralateral side of the pneumothorax.

Boerhaave Syndrome is more common in patients who presented vomiting before the chest pain started, were submitted to endoscopic procedures or had chest trauma.

How does this information can help you to solve your case?

++ Back to the case (action-1) -> Level 1 step 3

== Likelihood Ratio (detailed) ==

Likelihood ratio (LR) - like sensitivity and specificity, LR describe the discriminatory power of features in a clinical context, estimating the probability of disease. When the LR is higher than 1, the feature increases the probability; when lower than 1, reduces it.

We did not find features that increase the likelihood of myocardial ischemia. Moreover, our patient has a pleuritic chest pain that gets worse when the patient lays down.

In the EKG we found ST-segment elevation in almost all leads. Also, we found a depression of the PR segment in the DII lead.
